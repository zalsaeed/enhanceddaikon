<p>
For derived variables, holds Derivations and Factories for producing
Derivations.  All derived variables are produced by their specific
subclass of DerivationFactory.  A class interested in generating
Derivations will ask various DerivationFactories to instantiate them
from a number of VarInfos, and each DerivationFactory determines how
many (if any) Derivations are worth generating.
</p>

<p>
Each Derivation holds a set of base variables as VarInfo.  The
Derivation can generate: VarInfo of the derived variable it
represents; the value of the variable when given a ValueTuple.
