# README #

This project was originally created to get familiar with Daikon based on flaws we define in its results. However, as time pass and we gained better understanding of the issues that faces Daikon, we found that a majority of these issues are caused by the instrumentation interface (Chicory). Thus, Daikon version in this repository is intact. However, a complete redesign of how the instrumentation process works is implemented. Thus, the interesting changes are only in Chicory package. 

For more information about Daikon or Chicory visit the project's [official website](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/).
